      <description>This article contains write-ups for all cryptography challenges from ESAIP CTF 2023. All challenge files, prompts and solves are available here.
The event was nice and I had a great time competing with my friends. However, I&amp;rsquo;d like to quickly rant before diving into the write-ups.
&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;
 I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this has to be said but before giving source code, please make sure that it works. Added bonus: publish the Dockerfiles you use so players don&amp;rsquo;t have to waste time debugging.</description>

      <description>Vaulted  This secure multisignature application will keep our flag safe. Mind holding on to one of the backup keys?

 Vaulted was an easy crypto challenge from JustCTF 2023. To be fair it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a crypto challenge, you&amp;rsquo;d instantly know how to solve the challenge if you had a bit of crypto knowledge (especially on elliptic curves and how points can be represented) but if you didn&amp;rsquo;t a bit of source code reading would make the solution obvious.</description>

      <description>Dothell Revenge  Solves: 3
It seems that you now need a password to get some stars&amp;hellip; But you don&amp;rsquo;t have any. Time for some hacking!
Author: Oogle
 Dothell Revenge was a hard reverse-engineering challenge from ESAIP CTF 2023. It was a modified version of Dothell, a challenge from the 2022 edition that had 0 solves. I didn&amp;rsquo;t participate IRL last year, but I did this year, and even beat two of the best reversers I know to the first blood.</description>

      <description>Scream Like Viking  Our protagonist John is in a room, he hears some kind of noise, like something resonating. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand it&amp;hellip; Perhaps he could play with his own echoes to guess what the meaning of this famous resonance could be&amp;hellip;

 Scream Like Viking&#34;
This article is a write-up for &amp;ldquo;Scream Like Viking&amp;rdquo;, a cryptography challenge from PwnMe 2023.

      <description>Intro  Epreuve 12-3 – Coffre En tant que stagiaire vous avez accès aux locaux de la NSB. Vous allez collecter des informations dans les locaux. Un coffre est présent dans les locaux en salle rideau. Il appartient à Richard Cresus de la Tune. Essayez d’ouvrir ce coffre. Quel est l’IBAN contenu dans le coffre ? Format de la réponse : IBAN sans séparateur.
 Basically, we have to crack open an electronic safe.</description>

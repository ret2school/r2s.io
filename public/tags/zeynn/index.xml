      <description>Welcome folks,
This writeup is about the Midnight Sun CTF frank challenge on how to recover a full RSA private key, when half of it is erased. Thanks to this recent cryptohack write-up from which this challenge is (for me) inspired. Challenge therefore requires recovering the entire RSA key from this image:
Get the part of the private key visible: The first step of the challenge is to recover the visible part, to do this I quickly created a small OCR script with the pytesseract module in Python, to facilitate the recovery task.</description>

      <description>Hello world,
The write up is about the AC1750 challenge in HITCON ctf. It&amp;rsquo;s a forensic challenge, where we need to analyze packets captured by Wireshark to find out what an attacker is doing on the network.
First, we need to analyze intercepted traffic with wireshark. We see a lot of HTTP packets, and some contain &amp;ldquo;Archer&amp;rdquo; references. We can see weird UDP packets with port 20002.
After some google-fu on port 20002, we come accross this, and we can see there is a CVE targeting T-Link Archer devices.</description>

      <description>Welcome folks,
This writeup is about the Midnight Sun CTF frank challenge on how to recover a full RSA private key, when half of it is erased. Thanks to this recent cryptohack write-up from which this challenge is (for me) inspired. Challenge therefore requires recovering the entire RSA key from this image:
Get the part of the private key visible: The first step of the challenge is to recover the visible part, to do this I quickly created a small OCR script with the pytesseract module in Python, to facilitate the recovery task.</description>

We used the proximity browser in IDA with the &amp;ldquo;Add node -&amp;gt; Find path&amp;rdquo; mini-trick to get the path between the main and walk_end function. Once all the function names in the path where dumped, in the same order as in IDA, inside functions.txt, we just have to tell angr to discard, avoid, every state wherein the callstack is different from the path linking main and walk_end.</description>

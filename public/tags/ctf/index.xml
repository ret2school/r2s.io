      <description>UnionCTF - Cr0wnAir To solve this challenge, we had to exploit a vulnerability in jpv which allows us to bypass the regex validation in order to get a JWT. Then, we were able to change the algorithm from RS256 to HS256 and forge a new JWT with the public key, a key that we were able to retrieve thanks to a weak e.
 The source code of the app is given, so let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at it (only what will be interesting for us) :</description>

      <description>UnionCTF - Unionware This challenge gives us two files: an &amp;ldquo;unionware.ps1&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;important_homework.txt.unionware&amp;rdquo; containing seemingly random bytes. The challenge tells us that a ransomware encrypted the important homework and asks us to decrypt it.
Analyzing the Powershell While looking at the powershell, we can see an obfuscated Powershell command, which seems to split some random string and then evaluating it. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll just run the part of the script which deobfuscates the payload without executing it, which give us:</description>

      <description>Welcome guys,
This Write-Up is about de first pwn challenge of unionctf: babyrarf. It was a really easy challenge with a stack based buffer overflow. The source code was provided so, no need to reverse the binary :).
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the src!
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt; typedef struct attack { uint64_t id; uint64_t dmg; } attack; typedef struct character { char name[10]; int health; } character; uint8_t score; int read_int(){ char buf[10]; fgets(buf, 10, stdin); return atoi(buf); } void get_shell(){ execve(&amp;#34;/bin/sh&amp;#34;, NULL, NULL); } attack choose_attack(){ attack a; int id; puts(&amp;#34;Choose an attack:\n&amp;#34;); puts(&amp;#34;1.</description>

      <description>Hello world,
The write up is about the AC1750 challenge in HITCON ctf. It&amp;rsquo;s a forensic challenge, where we need to analyze packets captured by Wireshark to find out what an attacker is doing on the network.
First, we need to analyze intercepted traffic with wireshark. We see a lot of HTTP packets, and some contain &amp;ldquo;Archer&amp;rdquo; references. We can see weird UDP packets with port 20002.
After some google-fu on port 20002, we come accross this, and we can see there is a CVE targeting T-Link Archer devices.</description>

      <description>Hello world,
This writeup concerns the most difficult challenge I did on the CTF (having occupied myself a few hours to break it). At first glance, we have an &amp;ldquo;obfuscated&amp;rdquo; binary, which makes system calls to mmap and mprotect: we immediately think of a packer, and we will therefore have to unpack it.
Unpacking crackme Unpacking is not a problem on Linux when you are used to malware packers on Windows, thanks to radare2 and its visual mode.</description>

Files can be found here
For this challenge, we get an archive with a lot of files, the name of which seems to be a hash. Each file is an ELF x86_64 program file. In addition, a server listens, and requests:
Enter valid token to binary with name &amp;lt;8c235f89a8143a28a1d6067e959dd858&amp;gt; Token: at connection. We therefore understand quickly enough that we will have to automate the reversing of all these ELFs to send the correct token back to the server, and thus have the flag, the server requesting a series of tokens before spitting the flag.</description>

For this challenge, I first noticed (like in every other writeups) a big structure of offsets, that pointed to &amp;ldquo;funclets&amp;rdquo; followed by jump with rcx-relative offsets.
The relative jump function:
The first funclet just checks for the process being debugged, the &amp;ldquo;load_r9&amp;rdquo; funclet that jumps to the next funclet after skipping &amp;ldquo;n&amp;rdquo; bytes of garbage. Then the crackme calls a funclet &amp;ldquo;write_message&amp;rdquo; with the parameters (offset to &amp;ldquo;Why should I go out with you?</description>

      <description>Hi
This is my write up for the challange Cuba of CSAW CTF 2020 :
So this challenge is a CUBA program wrapped in a Windows Executable. CUBA is a GPU langage created by NVIDIA to work around GPU with high performance langage.
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html
Luckily there is a public SDK for it, with a disassembler :
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html
Using a tool called cuobjdump, we can extract the assembly code :
To extract ptx text from a host binary, use the following command: cuobjdump -ptx &amp;lt;host binary&amp;gt;  And after reversing the output, we can see that it&amp;rsquo;s a simple xor looping through a ciphered flag</description>

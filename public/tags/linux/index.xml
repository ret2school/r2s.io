      <description>Heap-Hop  Solves: 31 Medium
Heap exploitation is cool, and the best is when no free is used. &amp;gt;Try to pwn the challenge and get the flag remotely.
Note:
 You must spawn an instance to solve this challenge. You can connect to it with netcat: nc IP PORT  Author: Express#8049
Remote service at : nc 51.254.39.184 1336
 Heap-hop is a heap exploitation challenge I did during the pwnme CTF.</description>

      <description>VIP at libc  Sooo I heard that if you were VIP, you could access some specific features! Maybe one of those features can be used to get inside their system?
INFO : This challenge need to spawn an instance, you can connect to it with netcat: nc IP PORT

 VIP at libc is a basic stack based buffer overflow challenge.</description>

      <description>UTCTF 2023: Welcome  Welcome
1000
Note: while this challenge is nominally RE, there is some crypto-level/crypto-style math involved too.
Welcome to UTCTF! I made a special last minute program just for you to display a wonderful welcome message (+ flag!) I may have accidentally (okay&amp;hellip; purposely) made a small bug in my math &amp;gt; that makes this unsolvable(TM). Can you figure it out and fix it for me please?</description>

      <title>[SECCON CTF 2022 Quals] babyfile</title>

      <description>Introduction babyfile is a file stream exploitation I did during the SECCON CTF 2022 Quals event. I didnâ€™t succeed to flag it within the 24 hours :(. But anyway I hope this write up will be interesting to read given I show another way to gain code execution &amp;ndash; I have not seen before &amp;ndash; based on _IO_obstack_jumps! The related files can be found here. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with file stream internals, I advice you to read my previous writeups about file stream exploitation, especially this one and this other one.</description>

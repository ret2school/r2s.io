      <description>This article contains write-ups for all cryptography challenges from ESAIP CTF 2023. All challenge files, prompts and solves are available here.
The event was nice and I had a great time competing with my friends. However, I&amp;rsquo;d like to quickly rant before diving into the write-ups.

 I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this has to be said but before giving source code, please make sure that it works. Added bonus: publish the Dockerfiles you use so players don&amp;rsquo;t have to waste time debugging.</description>

      <description>Welcome folks,
This writeup is about the Midnight Sun CTF frank challenge on how to recover a full RSA private key, when half of it is erased. Thanks to this recent cryptohack write-up from which this challenge is (for me) inspired. Challenge therefore requires recovering the entire RSA key from this image:
Get the part of the private key visible: The first step of the challenge is to recover the visible part, to do this I quickly created a small OCR script with the pytesseract module in Python, to facilitate the recovery task.</description>

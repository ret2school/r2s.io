      <description>Introduction  I just learned how to use malloc and free&amp;hellip; am I doing this right?
 catastrophe is a heap challenge I did during the diceCTF 2022. I did have a lot of issues with the libc and the dynamic linker, thus I did a first time the challenge with the libc that was in /lib/libc.so.6, then I figured out thanks to my teammate supersnail that I was using the wrong libc.</description>

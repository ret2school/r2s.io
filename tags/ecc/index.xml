 Vaulted was an easy crypto challenge from JustCTF 2023. To be fair it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a crypto challenge, you&amp;rsquo;d instantly know how to solve the challenge if you had a bit of crypto knowledge (especially on elliptic curves and how points can be represented) but if you didn&amp;rsquo;t a bit of source code reading would make the solution obvious.</description>
